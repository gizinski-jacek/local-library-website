# Local Library Website

Local Library Website built with Node.JS/Express as backend, MongoDB as database, and using Heroku to host it.
Made by following <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Express_Nodejs'>Mozillas learning module.</a>

Along the way, I've fundamental knowledge about controllers, creating views using Pug, managing flow control when using asynchronous operations, querying the site's database using models, passing information to a view, creating and extending templates, and creating HTML forms and form handling code for modifying the data stored by the site.

###### This project is mostly finished.
