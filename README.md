# Local Library Website

Local Library Website built using NodeJS with Express, MongoDB as database, and hosting it on Heroku.

Along the way, I've fundamental knowledge about controllers, creating views using Pug, managing flow control when using asynchronous operations, querying the site's database using models, passing information to a view, creating and extending templates, and creating HTML forms and form handling code for modifying the data stored by the site.

###### This project is mostly finished.
